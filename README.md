# Your Project's Name
## Overview
One or two paragraphs providing an overview of your project.

Essentially, this part is your sales pitch.

## UX
In this project I wish to achieve a UX that is a nice and simple way to find some information based on search criteria.
I made the colors easy to look at and the pictures as calming and relaxing as possible.
The way i created the website as a single page application. Showing the current top 100 and the ability to search for artist/albums/songs.

## Features
### Existing Features

1. Mobile first responsive design so that the application looks good and performs well on multiple device resolution.
2. 
3. 
4. The search form allows you to search for an Album/Artist or Song name Using the [LastFM](https://www.last.fm/api/) API.
5. You can search for a Album/Artist and then you can click on the view songs button to view the songs in that Album.
6. View top 100 Is a table that shows you the top 100 songs currently you can also sort them by ranking name artist and playcount. You can search for songs in the top 100.

### Future Enhancements
1. If i was doing this in the future i would love to use spotifys api and be able to play music because with lastFM api i wasnt able to do this.
2. I Would like to add smoother animations.

## Testing
1. I used Chrome Dev Tools for debug Testing.
    1. I used the inspect feature to check different elements on my page.
    2. I used the coverage tab to check my css was being used on the given page.
    3. I used the network tab to see what was taking a long time to load and what wasn't loading.
    4. I used the computed tab to see the final state of a given element.
    5. I used the device toolbar to check that my website was rendered in a responsive manner on all device's
    6. I installed the chrome [lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse) plugin to use the audit feature to check Performance, progressive web app, Best practices, accessibility and SEO.
2. Application Testing
    1. 
    2. I ran all my tests on local host(root website) then pushed it onto github (where ran off the subdomain). Checked that all resources loaded properly off the root and subdomain.
    4. I put console logs where the data changed values in my code to find bug.
    5. I checked the chrome console for errors and what line they where on and fixed bugs this way too.
    6. I checked on mobile to see that everything was working correctly.
    7. When i was implementing the animations i had some problems with it working on mobile but after looking up a few threads i found a solution
    8. I tried to get the application to work on safari on mobile but couldn't seem to get it working properly there is overflow and I couldn't seem to get rid of this. I changed the size of the buttons and this didn't change it on other devices and browsers the buttons wrapped but on safari it didn't. I ran my css through an autoprefixer but this didn't seem to fix the problem
    9. When you search in that charts and u have it showing 25 songs the page shows blank html space.

## Deployment
I used a local host and once I was happy I committed to github to check that everything ran smoothly there as well.
