Who
This website is directed at people who want to find more information about there favourite song's/albums, and want a easy place to find the top 100 .




What 
I used Lastfm's api because i looked at many different apis and they would of been better for what i wanted but i couldnt mannaged to use thease apis cause they needed a backend server and this was out of my ability.
i also used dataTables to present my top 100 charts .



When 



Where



Why 
I decided to do this project on music cause i wanted to build off what i had from my last project and make it better 



How
I acesses various endpoints in the lastFms api to get the data about albums i wanted and to implment a search bar so that the user could get the artist/album/song they where looking for.
